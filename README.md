## Overview

Hapop is a VS Code extension designed to enhance productivity by providing fast file navigation within a workspace. Inspired by the efficiency of Vim and the navigation features of Harpoon, Hapop aims to streamline the process of opening and managing files in VS Code.

Developed by Ahmed Mahdi, Hapop was initially created for personal use but is now shared with the VS Code community to help others boost their workflow.

  - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>: Add the active file to the workspace list
