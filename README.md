# Hapop README


## Overview

Hapop is a VS Code extension designed to enhance productivity by providing fast file navigation within a workspace. Inspired by the efficiency of Vim and the navigation features of Harpoon, Hapop aims to streamline the process of opening and managing files in VS Code.

Developed by Ahmed Mahdi, Hapop was initially created for personal use but is now shared with the VS Code community to help others boost their workflow.

## How to Use

### Shortcuts

- **Windows**: 
  - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>: Add the active file to the workspace list
  - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>: View the workspace list and open files quickly without navigating

### Command Palette

- Open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and search for "Hapop" to access additional commands:
  - Remove a file from the list
  - More features coming soon!

## Features

- **Efficient Workflow**: Save active files to the list with a single shortcut and open them quickly from the workspace list.
- **Workspace Awareness**: Hapop recognizes files added to the list within a specific workspace, ensuring organization and persistence across projects.
- **Development Requests**: Users can request new features or report issues through GitHub or via email at ajm4k.email@gmail.com.

## Requirements

- VS Code installed on your laptop with an internet connection to download and install the extension.
